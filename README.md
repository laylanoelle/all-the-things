# all-the-things
This is a website about the things I love about the season of fall.
## why I chose fall
I chose fall because it is fall right now so I'm in that mood for it.
### 1. the weather

omg. fall weather is just so nice. it's not too hot but I could wear shorts or light pants if I wanted to. At the same time, I could wear jeans and a regular t-shirt and it would work in this weather too. Maybe it's cause I'm from California that I can't handle the cold very well at all, but fall is also the beginning of hoodie season for me. Also, the outfits to wear in this weather are some of the cutest in my opinion because there is such a large range, but you can also dress to match the warm colors of nature around you which I find to be very fun. 
additionally, the weather gets rainy sometimes and it's nice to just cozy up with your friends or just sort of have fun in the light drizzles or showers we experience. we barely get rain, so when we do it's always significant.

### 2. BAKING

you cannot have a great fall season without the baking. the apple pies, apple crisps, pumpkin gooey cake, carrot cake, all the things !! I love waking up in the morning and smelling fresh desserts being baked by my mom for us to take to school or to eat after. I myself rarely ever bake, but something about fall baking just makes it so special.

With Halloween as one of the highlights of the season, the movies are one of the best ways to enjoy the season. The movies also inspire some costumes and it's always fun to dress up.
## and thus, 
the end of the reasons why I love fall. thank you *bows*
