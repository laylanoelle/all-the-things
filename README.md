# all-the-things
this is a website about the numerous ideas of romantic scenarios that I have begun to write but never elaborated or had enough time to finish. actually, I have had enough time, I just lost interest because I knew none of it would happen to me. Feel free to finish these stories or use these storylines!

Having grown up watching Disney movies and been a lover of books my entire life, eventually finding myself on the app Wattpad during my boring days in quarantine was truly no surprise. At first, I expected to find amusement in childish works I had seen examples on various other forms of social media, thinking that all the things I would read would seem to have been written by a lovestruck middle schooler with no actual experience in romance. 
However, I was quickly proven wrong. The intricate makings of an enrapturing romance story were present and numerous on the site that I had mocked before. I found myself reading these stories and fanfictions feverously despite being teased by those close to me. I could not help it, I yearned to read about the what I myself have never experienced, but greatly desired.
In time, I used the site less and less, getting over what I deemed a quarantine phase. Nevertheless, my interest in romance never dwindled and during my free time, I would brainstorm stories of my own. These stories are the ones you will see here on this site. Although unfinished, I hope to inspire people to chase love stories of their own and not to dwell on the Internet to feed their i don't even know what.
